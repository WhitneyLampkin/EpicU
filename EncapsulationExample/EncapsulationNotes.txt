Encapsulation: Used to hide implementation details of a class.

Question: Why is this important to object oriented programming and object collaboration design?

Answer: Ultimately, we don't want other objects to have access to the class' details and implementation 
of another object and misuse them. 

Nor do we want to create unwanted dependencies that would make the code less flexible.

Encapsulation makes for a cleaner collaboration relationship between other objects. 

Leads to more maintainable code.
